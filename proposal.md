# Project Proposal: Keyword Spotting in Noisy Environments

## 1. General Topic
This project will focus on **keyword spotting (KWS)**, which refers to the detection of specific spoken keywords from continuous audio streams. KWS is widely used in applications such as voice assistants, smart home devices, and hands-free interfaces.  
A common challenge for KWS systems is **robustness in noisy environments** (e.g., background chatter, traffic, or music). The project will investigate approaches to improve performance under such conditions, leveraging available datasets and baseline models.

## 2. Research Question
- How can keyword spotting models maintain high accuracy when exposed to different types of noise?  
- What methods of feature extraction, data augmentation, or model architecture can improve robustness without significantly increasing computational cost?  

## 3. Proposed Approach
The proposed approach will explore KWS systems in a general framework:
- **Dataset**: Use standard corpora such as Google Speech Commands or other publicly available datasets.  
- **Features**: Investigate audio representations such as MFCCs, spectrograms, or learned embeddings.  
- **Models**: Consider a range of architectures, from traditional classifiers (e.g., CNN, RNN) to more recent deep learning models.  
- **Noise Handling**: Explore techniques like data augmentation, noise injection, or specialized training objectives to improve resilience.  

At this stage, the focus will be on **broad exploration** rather than committing to a single detailed solution. Specific implementations will be selected later based on feasibility and available resources.

## 4. Evaluation Plan
The project will adopt both objective and subjective evaluation methods:
- **Accuracy / F1-score**: Measure keyword recognition performance on clean vs. noisy test sets.  
- **Confusion matrix analysis**: Examine which keywords are most affected by noise.  
- **Robustness testing**: Test models under different noise levels (e.g., varying SNR conditions).  
- (Optional) **Efficiency metrics**: Compare computation and memory usage across models.  

## 5. Expected Outcome
- Identification of key factors influencing KWS performance under noise.  
- A baseline system that demonstrates acceptable accuracy in clean conditions, with analysis of performance drops under noise.  
- Insights into potential improvement strategies, which can be further explored in the final project phase.  

## 6. Project Plan
- **Week 5**: Conduct literature review on keyword spotting (KWS) and collect baseline GitHub implementations and datasets (e.g., Google Speech Commands).  
- **Week 6**: Implement a simple baseline KWS system and verify functionality on clean data.  
- **Week 7**: Introduce noisy conditions (add background noise, vary SNR levels) and evaluate baseline robustness.  
- **Week 8**: Explore possible improvements, such as data augmentation or alternative feature extraction methods.  
- **Week 9**: Test and compare improved models against the baseline, focusing on accuracy and robustness.  
- **Week 10**: Consolidate results, prepare analysis, and finalize the proposal report/presentation.
