## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Results and Discussion  

After 20 epochs of training, the baseline CNN achieved good performance under clean audio conditions but showed a clear drop in accuracy as noise increased.

### üîπ Quantitative Results

| **SNR (dB)** | **Accuracy (%)** |
|--------------:|----------------:|
| 30 | 68.5 |
| 20 | 63.4 |
| 10 | 56.7 |
| 0  | 46.2 |
| ‚àí5 | 37.8 |

**Observation:**  
The model performs well in clean or mild noise (‚â•20 dB) but rapidly loses accuracy below 10 dB, indicating limited robustness to strong background interference.

### üîπ Discussion  

These results align with previous studies showing that **noise robustness remains a key challenge** in small-footprint KWS systems (Li et al., 2022).  
At low SNRs, overlapping phonetic cues and spectral masking cause the CNN to confuse similar temporal patterns.  

Future improvements will include:  
- **SpecAugment** and additive noise augmentation (Park et al., 2019).  
- **Denoising or feature normalization front-ends** (Reddy et al., 2021).  
- **CNN-LSTM or attention-based architectures** for better temporal modeling.  
- Real-world environmental noise evaluation.
