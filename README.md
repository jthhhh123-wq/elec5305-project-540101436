# ELEC5305 Project Proposal

**Title:** Keyword Spotting in Noisy Environments  
**Student:** Jianing Zhang  
**SID:** 540101436  
**GitHub Username:** jthhhh123-wq  

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **keyword spotting (KWS)**, the task of detecting predefined spoken words from continuous speech. KWS is a core technology in voice assistants, smart devices, and hands-free systems. A key challenge is ensuring that these systems remain reliable in **noisy environments**, such as cafes, public transport, or crowded areas.

The project aims to:
- Implement a baseline KWS system using the Google Speech Commands dataset.  
- Evaluate its performance under clean versus noisy conditions.  
- Explore improvements such as **noise augmentation**, **alternative feature extraction (MFCC, spectrograms, embeddings)**, and **robust model architectures (CNN, RNN, Transformers)**.  

## Motivation
KWS systems are widely used in everyday life (e.g., "Hey Siri", "OK Google"), but their performance can deteriorate quickly with background noise. By studying and testing noise-robust strategies, this project seeks to balance **accuracy** and **efficiency**, making KWS systems more practical for real-world deployment.  

## Expected Outcomes
- A working baseline KWS implementation.  
- Quantitative evaluation under different noise levels (e.g., various SNR conditions).  
- Identification of techniques that improve robustness without excessive computational cost.  
- A GitHub repository with proposal, code, and documentation.  
- A GitHub Pages site summarizing the project and results.
